wellbook
========
The wellbook concept is about a single view of an oil well and its history- something akin to a "Facebook Wall" for oil wells.

This repo is built from data collected and made available by the [North Dakota Industrial Commission](https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas).

I used the wellindex.csv file to obtain a list of well file numbers (file_no), scraped their respective Production, Injection, Scout Ticket web pages, any available LAS format well logfiles, and loaded them into HDFS (/user/dev/wellbook/) for analysis.

To avoid the HDFS small files problem I used the Apache Mahout seqdirectory tool for combining my textfiles into SequenceFiles: the keys are the filenames and the values are the contents of each textfile.

Then I used a combination of Hive queries and the pyquery Python library for parsing relevant fields out of the raw HTML pages.

Tables:  
wellbook.wells -- [well metadata](https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/feeservices/flatfiles/flatfiles.asp) including geolocation and owner  
wellbook.well_surveys -- [borehole curve](https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/feeservices/getsurveydata.asp?ID=8895135722786)  
wellbook.production -- how much [oil, gas, and water](https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/feeservices/getwellprod.asp?filenumber=22786) was produced for each well on a monthly basis  
wellbook.auctions -- how much was paid for each parcel of land at [auction](http://www.land.nd.gov/minerals/mineralapps/auctions/auctionhistorysale.aspx)  
wellbook.injections -- how much [fluid and gas](https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/feeservices/getwellinj.asp?filenumber=5600) was injected into each well (for enhanced oil recovery and disposal purposes)  
wellbook.log_metadata -- metadata for each [LAS well log file](http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1142/)  
wellbook.log_readings -- sensor readings for each depth step in all [LAS well log files](http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1142/)  
wellbook.log_key -- [map](https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/feeservices/flatfiles/flatfiles.asp) of log mnemonics to their descriptions  
wellbook.formations -- manually annotated [map](https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/feeservices/flatfiles/flatfiles.asp) of well depths to rock formations  
wellbook.formations_key -- [Descriptions](https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/feeservices/flatfiles/flatfiles.asp) of rock formations  
wellbook.water_sites -- [metadata](http://waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/site/?stateCd=nd) for water quality monitoring stations in North Dakota
